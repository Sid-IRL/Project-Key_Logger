# Project KeyLogger

Keyloggers are basically **keyboard spies** designed to view the things you type on your keyboard

A __*keylogger*__, also called a keystroke logger,
or a System Monitor, is a monitoring technology that can
records each click of a key typed on a computer
Keyboard by a user.


__*Keyloggers*__ are mostly used by cyber criminals to
steal personal information, login credentials and sensitive
enterprise data. However, keyloggers can also be used
legally within enterprises to monitor activity on the company
Computers.

__*Keyloggers*__ can be either **hardware based** or
**software based**. Hardware based keyloggers can be a small
device that connects to a computer and keyboard or a module
installed inside the keyboard itself.It's relatively easy for these devices to go
unnoticed. 

On the other hand, keylogging software programs
don't require physical access to the user's computer. They
can be installed on purpose or downloaded unintentionally as
malware. 

Keylogger technology is very diverse, so no single detection method provides 100% protection.
But some protection tools and methods include anti keylogging
software, which scans for software based keyloggers and can
be more effective than general anti spyware and application whitelisting which only allows authorized programs to run on a system for hardware
based keyloggers.
